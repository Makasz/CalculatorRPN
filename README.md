![RPN](http://scoutant.org/rpn_60_60_24_7.png)

Very easy to use **RPN Calculator** for Android device. Neat and simple, yet powerful for everyday use. 

Do remember that with __Reverse Polish Notation__ you first type the numbers and you finish with the operator. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation.

For example, _how many hour in a week?_ :

24 7 +
